## Overview
This is Molonaviz's technical guide. If you are an end user, this is probably not the documentation you are looking for, and you should instead refer to the user guide.

This documents details the current structure of Molonaviz's backend and frontend, as well as the interactions between them (API). Any changes in this API should be written down here so that future maintainers of the project have a clear document giving all the conventions.

This document also lists additional features which could be implemented, remarks or issues, and a few unresolved bugs. 

This application is loosely based on the work done during the 2022 edition of the engineering trimester Molonari. However, it was initially entirely reworked Guillaume Vigne during the months following this trimester. Its goal is to be enhanced by future editions of the Molonari project.
